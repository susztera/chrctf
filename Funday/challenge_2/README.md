# Esoteric Encoding - Whitespace

The challenge consists of one distributed file saying Merry Christmas and a bunch of whitespace.
The flag is within the whitespace message - invisible, consisting only of spaces, tabs and newlines. 

Whitespace is considered a programming language on its own. I suspect people might try to mess with it and make it harder than it should be. Medium difficulty.
