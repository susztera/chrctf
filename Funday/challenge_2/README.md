# Esoteric Encoding - Whitespace

The challenge consists of one distributed file saying Merry Christmas and a bunch of whitespace.
The flag is within the whitesoace message - invisible, consisting only of spaces, tabs and newlines. Whitespace is considered a programming language on its own. 

I suspect people might try to mess with it on their own and make it harder than it should be. Maybe medium? Geuinely, uh, don't know.
