# Whitespace
### Oh no, this challenge is just a Merry Christmas message!.... not.

The message is invisible, consisting only of spaces, tabs and newlines. Whitespace is considered a programming language on its own. 
The Whitespace programming language gets its name from the fact that it uses only the 3 white characters: space, tab and newline. 
The source code of programs written in Whitespace are therefore invisible.

So, how does one code in Whitespace? It is very interesting but not really needed knowledge for this challenge. The main task is to figure out that the message *is* actually whitespace
encoded. There are plenty of online tools for decoding, for example the two top google search results for "whitespace decode",
[dCode](https://www.dcode.fr/whitespace-language) - which was used for encoding - and [vii5hard](https://vii5ard.github.io/whitespace/).

Using either will reveal the flag :)
