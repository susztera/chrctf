# Spectogram challenge
### A closer look at the audio file
The audio may at first seem like senseless beepboop, but after examining it in an audio program (for example, [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/)) a QR code reveals itself.

The QR code can be scanned with any QR scanner application. It is, in fact, a link leading to the flag.
