# Spectogram Steganography
### Two words I always mix up
The challenge is just one ditributed wave file that reveals a QR code when viewed as a spectogram. The QR code is a link that leads tothe flag. Very simple concept, difficult to
think of if someone has never seen it before. ComSec has some Pok√©mon fans who may have heard of something like this from an old [hoax/easter egg](https://imgur.com/gallery/plgl5zH).

Overall this challenge is pretty easy.
